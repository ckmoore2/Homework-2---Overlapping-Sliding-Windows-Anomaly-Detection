# Homework-2---Overlapping-Sliding-Windows-Anomaly-Detection
In this assignment you will detect anomalies in a Nitrate time series using a threshold-based method with fixed-size, overlapping sliding windows (step size = 1). You will compute a q-percentile threshold within each window and classify the newly added data point as normal or anomaly. Ground truth indicates there are 77 anomaly events in total.
